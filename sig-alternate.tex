\section{Introduction}
Doing business as a software company now, and expectedly increasingly in the future, needs to deal with increasing rapid changes in technology and competition. For a company to endure these changes in the business environment finding new strategies to distinguish themselves from their competitors is essential.\cite{stefan:valuebased}       
In order to accommodate these different company strategies and improve productivity a number of different software development processes have been developed. 
Throughout the last 60 years of software development, 5 different development processes categories have been created to accommodate the different business strategies and thereby improving the efficiency of the company. These categories can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:states}, arranged with oldest first.

\begin{figure}
\caption{Development processes view as states}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Traditional Development
\item Agile Development
\item Continues Deployment 
\item Continues Experimentation in value-oriented Software Development
\end{enumerate}
\label{fig:states}
\end{figure}

The general trend from the first to the last category is that the development process become more and more agile and iterative. This general trend can be view as attempts to overcome a number of general uncertainties or risk in software development, see Figure \ref{fig:states}.
As an example, take the jump from the traditional Waterfall to a agile framework like Scrum where the main purpose is to overcome these risks by using a more iterative and incremental approach\cite{sutherland:scrum}.
\begin{figure}
\caption{General risks and uncertainties in Software Development}
\begin{itemize}
\item Changes in requirements
\item Risk of having the wrong requirements
\item Risk of missing requirements
\item Risk of not being the first
\end{itemize}
\label{fig:generalrisks}
\end{figure}

On the last state of development is the value-oriented software development and its use of Continuous Experimentation to improve quality management. 

\subsection{Value-oriented Software Development}
Value-oriented or Value-based Software Development (VBSE) focuses on reducing the waste of resources on activities with negative return investments. For instance, Boehm (2006) argues that the wasted effort by extensive testing could be as high as \$300 billion per year\cite{stefan:valuebased}.

VBSE originates from the "4+1" theorem represented on Figure \ref{fig:fouronetheorem}. This theorem states that a given company's enterprise will only be successful if it makes the success-critical stakeholders into winners. Therefore, the first step towards VBSE, is to identify \textit{all} stakeholders and  focus on those who are critical to the success.

The success-critical stakeholder (SCS) Win-Win theory at the centrer of the figure is used to decide which values are important and describes how to assure their success and realisation. The output of the additional four theories is the input for this decision making. Put simply, identify the values and determine their importance for the SCS. Further analyse how the identified SCS' values affect the decision making. Find and evaluate the dependencies and their impact on the values. Plan to adapt to changes and thereby control the realization of the value.\cite{stefan:valuebased}

\begin{figure}
\caption{The "4+1" theorem, by Boehm}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Umlet/4+1theorem}
\label{fig:fouronetheorem}
\end{figure} 

The essence of VBSE and were it distinguish itself from the previous processes and strategies is that it does not operate with the same values-neutral approach. Where previous strategies treated every requirement, use case or defect with equal importance the VBSE seek to find a mutually satisfactory set of objectives for SCS' and company, and work these into a system. In other words, the value created from different requirements, use case, quality factors ect. are not of equal in size or importance. The size and importance of a value is defined by the success-critical stakeholders. Further, a item representing something valuable is not to be implemented if it is not important for the success of the enterprise. Derived from the W theory\footnote{The Win-Win theory of the "4+1" theory}, a successful enterprise is where the SCS becomes winners. 

This way of thinking manifests itself in a number of activities, which tries to maximize the value created on different levels of the engineering practices. These activities are can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:vbseActivities}
\begin{figure}
\caption{Activities in Value-Oriented Software development}

\paragraph{Disadvantages}

\paragraph{Quality management in VBSE}
Quality management in VBSE is focussing on prioritizing desired quality factors with respect to the stakeholders' value propositions. A crucial part of the quality management in VBSE is to identify what these factors are. Since software quality is multidimensional, it follows that the quality of a system can acceptable in one situation is not in odder. For instance a making a system with high efficiency but unknown or low reliability might be sufficient for a smart phone game application but as a system for a security system for a space program it is a no go. Further since quality costs money, narrowing down the which qualities really are important for stakeholders is a way to reduce wasted effort and money. In VBSE the quality management is concerned with identifying the most important qualities which should characterize the system and making sure that these are achieved to the extend where it meets the requirements of the stakeholders and no more. 
The main problem in VBSE is how to find out which quality factors are important, to which extend they should be meet. 

Further it is a problem in VBSE to verify that the quality goal identified is actually the correct once. Having a cap between the identified desired quality need and the \textit{true} quality need can lead to a business failure. 
Traditional development proposes to make studies of the user and the environment of the system to give evidence for a verification or rejection of a set of quality goal. But these studies can be costly and misleading, since the user does not always know what they want. Nor does a assessment of the environment prof whether one solution is better than another. Without any hard evidence, quality management in VBSE and other strategies can be a nasty business. Continuous Experimentation can be applied in this situation to reduce this risk of having wrong quality requirement. 
Continuous Experimentation is a strategy which is build on top of Continuous deployment.  

\subsection{Continuous Delivery and Deployment}
Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment are somewhat similar.
Continuous Delivery is a software engineering process focussing on a getting shorter development cycles, faster delivery and feedback, see Figure \ref{fig:deliverydeploment}. This is achieved by automating test and integration in a testing environment. Thereby making only the development and acceptance test manual. In continuous deployment the hole process after development is automated until the deployment in the production environment. There might still be manual work to do in the different tasks, like writing additional test, but the process of between the steps are completely automated.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Continuous Experimentation}
The section Continuous Experimentation is mainly grounded in the paper \cite{bowman:reasoning}.
The development approach is mainly inspired from Lean Development which focus upon the utilization of the budget to earn the most profit.
\subsubsection{Lean Software Development}
Lean Software Developnment\cite{poppendieck:lean} was developed back in ?? and is based upon the following principles

\begin{enumerate}
\item Eliminate Waste
\item Amplify learning
\item Decide as late as possible
\item Deliver as fast as possible
\item Empower the team
\item build quality in
\item see the whole
\end{enumerate}

The following is a short description of the points found in the book \cite{poppendieck:lean}

\paragraph{Eliminate Waste}
Waste is anything which does not directly add value upon the product. 

This is Design diagrams, which is not utilized by the developer or the project manager in any way. 
It is unused requirements, unused features or features which is not needed right now. 

Eliminating Waste is generally avoided by looking at each task done in a timeline for a project
and find any tasks or part of tasks which doesn't bring any value to the product and can be 
skipped for further processes or projects.
 
\paragraph{Amplify Learning}
Amplify Learning is generally described as using the Test Driven Development(TDD) approach in order to 
get instant feedback on success.
This means small iterations along with integration testing to quickly test if new features broke anything.

\paragraph{Decide as Late as Possible}
For creative and design based tasks like software development a lot uncertainties are involved. 
The best approach for efficiency with big uncertainties is to make late decisions in order to have multiple
options, as not all options are good and there might be better options around. 

This also means that complex systems should support that parts of those systems can change in the late process
 of the development without the hassle to implement them.

\paragraph{Deliver as fast as possible}
Deliver as fast as possible is partly connected to the Eliminate Waste. 
Back in time it was more valuable to delay software and increase the quality, along with carefully making 
the right decisions.

Today it it more valuable to move fast and the cost of software has changed to the cost of human hours. 
These changes in the field has made it more important to elimate waste and deliver as fast as possible 
by just fulfilling the required terms.

\paragraph{Empower the team}
Empower the Team, is for Lean Software Development the process of enlightning the entire team of the 
details of the project and thereby increase the quality by having every developer on the same side. 

These empowerings are archived by having the individual developers talk together in meetings telling
about what they have to do, combined charts which shows how the software is improved.

\paragraph{Build integrity in}
To Build Integrity in, means that it should be possible to extend the software for future requirements 
as software generally has to adapt to the moving world and additonally be easy to maintain to reduce waste.

\paragraph{See the whole}
The principle `See the whole` covers how to avoid suboptimality of the software. 
It is described as developers tend to the features at which, they are specialized into.
This leads to part of the systems being really good and other parts to be suboptimal.

\subsubsection{Assumption}
The Initial process for continuous experimentation is the Assumption.
In the Assumption phase an idea is created, which is a change or extension to the current software.

during the assumption the benefits of the

\label{fig:continuousdev}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Umlet/conexp}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Hypothesis}
The first step in order to define a task in continuous experimentation is defining the requirements for the experiment to succeed. 

In order to succeed the experiment has to bring value to the product. In order to measure how well the experiment perform a hypothesis which describe an expected outcome from the experiment.

The core of the hypothesis has to be quality requirements, which can be tested and verified in order to verify the value of the experiment to the product. 

\subsubsection{Design Minimal Viable Product}

\subsubsection{Data Analysis}
Once the minimal viable product has been deployed into production. Users are monitored and data about the users and their behavior is collected for analysis of how the change has affected the product. 

This process require data scientist in order to  analyze the benefits and consequences of the experiment upon the product. 

\subsubsection{Validation}
